          Cornell University's Ganędagǫ Hall, proudly named to honor the Ganędagǫ,
          the Cayuga Nation, opened its doors in the fall of 2021, symbolizing a 
          sleek, modern tribute to Indigenous heritage. But as students returned 
          this spring, they found unexpected and uninvited guests had colonized 
          their rooms: mice. The infestation, arriving just after two arson incidents, 
          was an unsettling reminder of another invasion centuries ago. 
        </p>

        <p>
          When a student at Cornell University, Finn Kennedy '25, returned on 
          January 23, he hoped to ease back into his routine, only to be greeted 
          by an invader rustling through his trash can. “I quickly turned on my 
          flashlight, and I saw a mouse jump out and fall on the floor,” Kennedy 
          said. He and his suitemates named the intruder Remy, after the rat from 
          Ratatouille, and even left out a cookie for him. Cute, isn't it?
        </p>

        <p>
          However, not all students welcomed these new inhabitants. Camila Monter 
          '25, who is allergic to rodents, found herself sneezing and coughing. 
          “The next day, I saw a mouse running into my roommate's closet. That's
          when I realized they were the cause of my allergic reaction,” Monter said. 
          The university's response? Simple: be cleaner. Executive Director of 
          Housing & Residential Life, Tim Blair, advised students to manage their 
          trash better and store food properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps, the students were merely reclaiming the space that once belonged 
          to them, metaphorically speaking. After all, what's a little dispossession 
          among friends? Cornell's very grounds whisper tales of the Ganędagǫ, 
          from whom this land was taken. The mice, in their humble way, remind us of 
          the original inhabitants who were forced out by more than just trash 
          management issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Monter and others, neat and tidy as they are, disagree with the cleanliness 
          argument. “My roommate and I would never leave food on the floor,” Monter 
          insisted. Yet, the mice persisted, undeterred by human claims of neatness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Residents expressed frustration at the university's sluggish response. 
          “The University should have acted more swiftly,” Kennedy said. Instead, 
          students endured weeks of waiting for mice traps, all while juggling 
          classes and seeking temporary housing. Monter detailed her ordeal of 
          finding a place to stay, managing the first week of classes, and 
          decontaminating her belongings—all at her own expense.
        </p>

        <p>
          The irony is palpable. Here, in Ganędagǫ Hall, students face an invasion 
          that mirrors the original conquest of Native land. The mice, unwelcome 
          and persistent, evoke a historical parallel, turning the residents into 
          modern-day "natives" besieged by an invasive force. As the students of 
          Cornell struggle against their tiny invaders, perhaps they can pause to 
          reflect on the larger story of displacement and invasion and the ongoing 
          legacy of settler colonialism. After all, isn't it just a matter of 
          perspective who the true invaders are?

                    The mice, symbolizing the settler, remain 
                    resilient despite human attempts to eliminate them. This 
                    invites the audience to consider that the displacement of 
                    Indigenous peoples is not merely a past event but an ongoing 
                    struggle. Native communities persist in asserting their presence 
                    and rights, enduring centuries of marginalization and continuing 
                    to challenge their erasure.

                  <p>
                    The university's response to the infestation, which shifts 
                    the responsibility for cleanliness onto students, mirrors a 
                    broader tendency of institutions to deflect accountability 
                    and oversimplify complex issues. This approach reflects how 
                    institutions often address Indigenous concerns, providing 
                    superficial solutions without addressing the deeper historical 
                    and social contexts.

                  <p>
                    The final question—who the true invaders are—invites the 
                    audience to rethink their understanding of colonization and 
                    displacement. By comparing the students' experience with mice 
                    to the historical plight of Indigenous peoples, the text 
                    challenges readers to empathize with the Native perspective 
                    and acknowledge the lasting impact of settler colonialism.
