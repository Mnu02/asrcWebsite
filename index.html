                    Right here, you've stumbled onto what I call 
                    a fancy disaster ðŸ¥¸ my final project. We're about to head first
                    into the murky waters of settler colonialism, where the past
                    isn't just discussed, it's dissected with a hint of ridicule 
                    and a whole lot of truth. We're peeling back the layers of 
                    some gloriously bad decisions and the people who made them. 
                    So buckle up, it's going to be a bumpy ride through history
                    â€” one that might just make you see things a little differently.
                    </p>

                                from The Cornell Daily Sun. Thanks to my intrusive thoughts,
                                I invite you to witness a different perspective 
                                about having your space invaded.

                                were asked to say one word or a short phrase about 
                                how they feel about Thanksgiving. Boy, did they not
                                share how they really feel!? Take a look.
                                Question everything! - or don't...

                                we'll take a deep dive into the fine art of 
                                conquest that was powered by the Morril Act of 
                                1862 that allowed for the creation of land-grant 
                                colleges in the US using the proceeds from sales 
                                of federally owned (is it now?) land, often obtained 
                                from Native American tribes through treaty, cession, 
                                or seizure.
