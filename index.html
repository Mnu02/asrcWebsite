                        This website is meant to expose the injustices that have 
                        been committed against Native Americans and how those 
                        injustices are presently ongoing. The user is supposed 
                        to think critically to question the information they will
                        come across here. Nothing is taken for granted. Analyse 
                        everything and don't leave anything to chance. You might 
                        realize that you are participating in the dispossession
                        of Native Americans.

                                from The Cornell Daily Sun. Thanks to my intrusive thoughts,
                                I invite you to witness a different perspective 
                                about having your space invaded.

                                were asked to say one word or a short phrase about 
                                how they feel about Thanksgiving. Boy, did they not
                                share how they really feel!? Take a look.
                                Question everything! - or don't...

                                we'll take a deep dive into the fine art of 
                                conquest that was powered by the Morril Act of 
                                1862 that allowed for the creation of land-grant 
                                colleges in the US using the proceeds from sales 
                                of federally owned (is it now?) land, often obtained 
                                from Native American tribes through treaty, cession, 
                                or seizure.
