        We have seen and thought about invasion of Native lands and celebration of Thankgiving.
        It is important to take the time to see how univerisities (Hello Cornell) in the US
        came to be and their efforts (or lack thereof) to try to make repatriations to Native People.

              <p>
                the great American universities set forth on a mission. Not a 
                mission of knowledge, mind you, but of acquisition. Armed with 
                the Morrill Act of 1862, which was supposedly about creating 
                educational opportunities, these institutions participated in a 
                grand land grab that would make even the most ambitious monopoly 
                player blush. Land, of course, was just lying around, seemingly 
                waiting for the refined touch of academia. Who better to cultivate 
                the wilderness than the great minds who brought you Latin diplomas 
                and football scholarships? And so, they took—acres upon acres of 
                Native American land, no questions asked.

              <p>
                Fast forward to today, and our beloved universities are still 
                clutching onto Native American artifacts like a toddler with a 
                toy they refuse to share. The rationale? "The Natives wouldn't 
                know how to take care of them." Because, obviously, the people 
                who created these artifacts centuries ago need a lesson in 
                preservation from institutions barely two centuries old. Let's 
                talk about the Nagpra Act of 1990, which was supposed to right 
                these wrongs by returning sacred artifacts to their rightful 
                owners. How's that going? About as well as a group project where 
                one person does all the work, and the rest just watch. U.S. 
                Senator Brian Schatz has had to step in, shaming universities 
                into doing what should have been done decades ago.

              <p>
                This whole scenario would be hilarious if it weren't so tragic. 
                It's like watching a historical re-enactment where the invaders 
                are celebrated, and the invaded are given a participation trophy. 
                We name dorms with Native American names, acknowledging the lands 
                we've taken, only to infest those dorms with mice. A fitting 
                metaphor for the ongoing invasion, wouldn't you say? And then 
                there's Thanksgiving—where we gather to celebrate a meal that 
                never happened in the way we imagine, on land that was never 
                ours to begin with. It's the ultimate historical irony, 
                repackaged as a family holiday.

            <p>
              So why does this matter today? Because history has a funny way of 
              repeating itself. As we debate land acknowledgments and artifact 
              repatriation, the underlying issues of settler colonialism persist. 
              The past isn't just a series of events; it's a legacy of dispossession 
              that continues to affect Native and Black communities. By holding onto 
              these artifacts and lands, universities perpetuate the myth that Native 
              cultures are relics of the past, rather than living, vibrant communities. 
              The refusal to return what was taken is not just an academic oversight—it's 
              an ongoing act of erasure and disrespect.

          <p>
            We can start by telling these stories with the irony they deserve. 
            By highlighting the absurdity of these actions, we can bring attention 
            to the ongoing injustices faced by Native and Black communities. It's 
            time for universities to do more than just acknowledge the land—they need 
            to return it. So, let's raise a glass to the institutions that taught 
            us everything except how to give back what they stole. Here's to 
            hoping they learn that lesson soon.
