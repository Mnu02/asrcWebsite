        After the incident with the mice, I thought about about the questions I 
        asked you in the previous page. I asked myself how Indigenous students 
        felt about certain holidays that are associated with violence towards 
        Native people. Let's say üëÄ I went around the school asking people how they 
        felt about Thanksgiving. The following were their responses (and my 
        inner thoughts üëÄ):

              <p>
                Ah, the great American tradition of storytelling. If you can't 
                find the truth, just make something up! Thanksgiving is a national 
                holiday where the narrative is as stuffed as the turkey, and 
                reality gets served with a side of denial.
              </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><span>"Sadness, total sadness. Thanksgiving is the time when my f
              amily gets together and tells stories about our creation myths, and who 
              we were, who we are, and really what we lost."</span><br> 
              <p>
                I can feel her sense of loss as she repeats the term 'sadness', 
                but hey nothing brings family together like a shared sense of 
                loss. So while one family carves the turkey, another carves out 
                pieces of history, trying to remember what the holiday really cost. 
                Nostalgia with a side of sorrow!

            <li><span>"Inaccurate. I like the overall idea of Thanksgiving, but not where it actually comes from."</span><br>
              <p>
                That's right, let's keep the feast and ditch the facts! Who needs 
                historical accuracy when you've got pumpkin pie and football? 
                Let's celebrate the warm, fuzzy feeling of camaraderie while 
                glossing over a past that's as messy as Aunt Edna's gravy.

        <ul>
          <li><span>"Turkey and white pilgrims. I don't know what the first Thanksgiving 
            was, but I highly doubt it was a group of happy pilgrims and a group 
            of happy Indians cooking turkey together."</span><br> 
            <p>
              Indeed, nothing says historical inaccuracy like envisioning a harmonious 
              dinner party between invaders and the invaded. Do you really think 
              that the story was that simple? That initial feast must have been 
              a real kumbaya moment‚Ä¶ if you ignore the subsequent centuries of 
              conflict and displacement.

      <ul>
        <li><span>"Family."</span><br> 
          <p>
            Because nothing says family like gathering together to celebrate a 
            holiday built on the foundations of broken treaties and stolen land. 
            Pass the cranberry sauce and the generational trauma, please. It is 
            good though that we still see these families being able to gather 
            together - that at least shows that the Indian is not extinct. But 
            wouldn't it have been nice for them to gather to celebrate how their 
            ancestors peacefully transitioned into the after-life?

        <li><span>"There was a massacre. Puritans came and slaughtered them. 
          They don't want to eat with the savage. They slaughtered millions of us. 
          Sighs, I don't know why they call themselves the Puritans."</span><br> 
          <p>
            ‚ÄúPuritans,‚Äù indeed‚Äîa misnomer so ironic it deserves its own holiday. 
            With a zeal for purity that included cleansing the land of its original 
            inhabitants, these settlers were nothing if not thorough. Perhaps they 
            thought the 'pure' in Puritan referred to their diet of unseasoned 
            narratives and sanitized histories.

          <li><span>"Romanticized. I would definitely say the story of 
            Thanksgiving and coming together is definitely romanticized because 
            of the horrible atrocities that were committed against us."</span><br> 
            <p>
              Romanticized, you say? What a lovely choice of words to describe 
              the artful dodging of inconvenient truths. Thanksgiving: a tale 
              of unity scripted with a heavy hand, where the ink blotches are 
              blood stains and the parchment is a treaty never meant to be honored. 
              A narrative so polished, it gleams under the autumnal setting sun.

        <ul>
          <li><span>"Thanksgiving just‚Äîto me‚Äîjust represents a day for football 
            and lots of good eating and trying not to think about what it really 
            represents."</span><br> 
            <p>
              Perfection in avoidance, indeed! Why bother with the pesky undertones 
              of historical trauma when there are games to be watched and gravy 
              boats to be passed around? Let the true essence of Thanksgiving be 
              drowned out by cheers for the home team and the clatter of cutlery, 
              far from the battle cries and broken promises.
